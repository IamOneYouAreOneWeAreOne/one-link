# One Link CHANGELOG

Per-release notes for One Link. Each entry summarises the ADRs landed
in that release; full architectural rationale lives in
[`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/).

The version scheme is semver-aligned but pre-1.0: 0.x.y means alpha,
breaking wire changes allowed between minor versions. Wire-format
compatibility with prior peers is preserved via capability negotiation
where practical (`NATIVE_TRANSFER_V1`, `DOUBLE_RATCHET_V1`).

---

## [0.21.0-alpha] — 2026-05-11 — File engine v2

**Headline**: implementation of the shipped scope in
[`FILE_ENGINE_V2_PLAN.md`](docs/FILE_ENGINE_V2_PLAN.md) across Phase A1 + A2 +
B + C + D, plus the Coherence ↔ Rust codegen scaffold. Deferred hardware gates
and non-route bandit controllers are called out explicitly below and in the
plan scorecard.
16 Rust crates were present in `native/` at that milestone. The native
chunk-store transport gained daemon integration, but this alpha changelog does
not establish production readiness, full platform parity, or a verified
release.

### 2026-07-23 live post-quantum daemon-channel handshake

- Current daemon channels use a distinct v3 wire handshake with a signed,
  canonical suite offer/selection for X25519 + ML-KEM-768, full transcript
  binding, an independent X25519 contribution, and mutual key confirmation
  before the channel is returned to application code.
- The native PQ capability is advertised only after the exact ABI passes an
  in-process encapsulation/decapsulation self-test. Missing or unhealthy native
  code fails closed before the initiator emits a handshake frame.
- Legacy/classical channels are rejected by default. Migration requires an
  explicit downgrade policy and those channels report `pq_protected=False`.
- This protects daemon session establishment against harvest-now-decrypt-later;
  it is not a claim that Ed25519 identity signatures, browser/WebRTC channels,
  or every shipped platform artifact are post-quantum qualified.

### 2026-07-21 large-transfer reliability and storage closure

- Desktop and phone uploads now mint stable idempotency keys, durably stage
  before returning `202 Accepted`, and replay the exact admitted result after
  response loss. Browser retries coalesce; completed phone retries re-hash
  content before replay so equal name/size cannot impersonate different bytes.
- Receiver completion is proven by an authenticated, durable `FILE_COMMIT`
  receipt. Sender retries preserve one delivery nonce and reconcile ambiguous
  legacy outcomes without emitting another offer.
- Chunk receipt replay, restart-safe resume ownership, exact staged-file
  identity, and bounded adaptive high-RTT windows eliminate duplicate writes
  and the 250 KiB/16-chunk bandwidth-delay-product collapse seen on the
  reported 596 ms route.
- Relay forwarding now has an exact 512 MiB process-wide payload budget plus a
  protected 4 MiB control reserve. Browser DataChannel work and phone uploads
  are likewise bounded, tracked, and drained before shutdown.
- Folder equality probes no longer create transfer/activity rows. Storage
  lifecycle tooling now performs content-verified graph audit, recoverable
  quarantine, rollback, and a separately approved 30-day-grace purge.
- Added adversarial lost-ACK, duplicate-init, concurrent-finalization,
  malformed-frame, crash-recovery, relay-overload, storage-orphan, browser
  call, media-soak, and 385 MiB transfer regression gates.

### Phase A1: chunk store foundation (ADRs 0001–0008)

- `ol_chunk` — content-addressed FastCDC v2020 (8/64/256 KiB) + BLAKE3
  chunk addressing + chunk envelope.
- `ol_chunk_store` — LSM-indexed content-addressed chunk log + bloom-
  filter front + WAL-coupled durability.
- `ol_aead` — per-chunk multi-frame AEAD (AES-256-GCM / ChaCha20-
  Poly1305) backed by `ring` (BoringSSL-derived assembly).
- `ol_wal` — crash-only write-ahead log with CRC32-Castagnoli per-
  record + tail-truncation recovery.
- `one_link_native` — pyo3 binding crate exposing every native crate
  as `one_link_native.<submodule>` (abi3-py311+).

### Phase A2: transport (ADR-0009, ADR-0010)

- `ol_quic` — QUIC transport via `quinn` 0.11. Self-signed identity-
  bound TLS via `rustls` + `aws-lc-rs`. The current daemon uses
  capability- and runtime-gated QUIC file lanes with authenticated peer
  binding. Multi-stream, 0-RTT, and connection-migration support in the
  transport primitive do not establish a whole-session cutover: daemon
  control/message traffic retains its authenticated channel, and WebRTC is
  retained for browser-as-peer.

### Phase B: genius layer (ADRs 0011–0016)

- `ol_bloom` — Bloom-filter transfer init. Receiver sends Bloom of
  chunk hashes; sender XORs against manifest; ships only the true delta.
- `ol_fountain` — LT (Luby Transform) fountain codes using the robust
  soliton distribution (ADR-0015). RaptorQ (RFC 6330) remains deferred
  pending IPR review and a versioned wire-format upgrade.
- `ol_fec` — Reed-Solomon FEC over GF(2^8) with SSSE3 PSHUFB SIMD.
- `ol_erasure` — Erasure-coded durability with stripe descriptor
  metadata.

### Phase C: multi-axis baseline (ADRs 0017–0027)

- **ADR-0017** PQ-hybrid KEM (ML-KEM-768 + X25519 via BLAKE3 X-Wing
  combiner). `ol_pqkem` crate.
- **ADR-0019** Multi-armed bandit route selection (Beta-Bernoulli
  Thompson sampling). `ol_bandit` is generic, but only route selection
  is production-active; chunk-size, parallelism, FEC, prefetch, pacing,
  and compression controllers remain deferred.
- **ADR-0020** Per-chunk forward-secret ratchet (BLAKE3 keyed-hash
  chain). `ol_ratchet` crate.
- **ADR-0021** Capability layer — macaroon-style HMAC-chained caveats
  over BLAKE3. `ol_capability` crate. **1M-iter attenuation soundness
  gate** (`child.accepts(ctx) ⇒ parent.accepts(ctx)`) passes in
  5.94 s with 0 violations.
- **ADR-0022** CRDT shared folders — vector clock + OR-set + LWW
  register composition. `ol_crdt` crate. **1M-iter lattice-laws gate**
  (commutativity + associativity + idempotency) passes in 7.46 s.
- **ADR-0023** Hardware-bound keys, TOFU-degrading. `ol_hwkey` crate.
- **ADR-0024** Phase C-3 wiring status — shadow / dual-issue posture
  for the 5 daemon migration primitives.
- **ADR-0025** Chunk-store transport pipeline — composed
  `NativeTransferSession` (KEM + ratchet + CDC + AEAD + ChunkStore).
  Bench: native is **1.14–1.44× faster than legacy** at every size
  16 KiB → 64 MiB after the BoringSSL fast-path default.
- **ADR-0026** `NATIVE_TRANSFER_V1` capability + `FILE_NATIVE_CHUNK`
  wire format. The current indexed native file lane is capability-gated and
  default-on only when the native runtime and peer negotiation qualify it
  (rollback via `ONE_LINK_NATIVE_TRANSFER=0`); it is not a universal session
  transport claim.
- **ADR-0027** Shadow → authoritative cutovers: bandit drives route
  picks in `AdaptiveTransferBrain.decide()`; folder mirror active
  cross-check + divergence counter; macaroon advertised on
  `CAPABILITY_GRANT` wire as `macaroon_b64`.

### Phase D: visionary layer (ADRs 0028, 0033)

- **ADR-0028 #1** Tau-field routing — `ol_routing` crate. τ_c-
  weighted Dijkstra + hysteresis-gated next-hop swap. Harvest from
  `OneField/onefield/mesh/routing.cl`. **Acceptance gate**: 100%
  chunk-loss reduction on fragile-graph benchmark (plan: ≥20%).
- **#2** Byzantine-tolerant tau — `ol_routing::byzantine` module.
  BFT thresholds (`floor((N-1)/3)`) + random-geometric graph density
  + `tau_claim_corroborated` (catches malicious peers reporting fake
  high τ_c).
- **#3** Active inference prefetch — `ol_prefetch` crate. Time-
  weighted co-occurrence predictor over (peer, file_id) access
  traces. **Acceptance gate**: cold-start convergence ≤50 iters;
  cohort prior transfer converges in 1 iter.
- **#4** Persistent homology durability — `ol_homology` crate. H0
  components + bridge detection via DFS; composite `fragility_score`
  for replication priority. **Acceptance gate**: partition flag in 1
  round, 0% FP on 100 random 4-regular graphs (plan: ≤5% FP).
- **#5** Grammar compression — `ol_grammar` crate. Re-Pair on byte
  streams.
- **#6** Plausibly deniable storage — `ol_duress` crate. `DuressGate`
  with constant-time real-vs-decoy decision + covert ratchet-header
  signal. **CT timing gate**: 1.014× wall-clock variance (plan:
  <1.20×). The validation pass caught + fixed a real side-channel
  (1.448× → 1.014×).
- **#7** Formal verification — TLA+ specification at
  `docs/formal/Capability.tla` modelling the capability grant + revoke
  + attenuation state machine. Verified safety invariants:
  `NoKeyReuse`, `NoDoubleGrant`, `NoReplay`, `ClockMonotonic`.
- **Coherence ↔ Rust codegen scaffold** — `ol_codegen` crate. Minimal
  CL `struct` grammar parser + Rust struct + canonical-LE encoder
  emitter. **Byte-equivalence CI gate**: 1M random struct shapes
  round-trip in 1.79 s.

### Python adapters

Every native crate the daemon needs to call surfaces as
`one_link_native.<submodule>` + a thin `*_native.py` wrapper:

- `chunk_native.py`, `chunk_store_native.py`, `wal_native.py`,
  `aead_native.py`, `quic_native.py` (Phase A1+A2)
- `fountain_native.py`, `fec_native.py`, `bloom_native.py`,
  `pqkem_native.py`, `erasure_native.py`, `bandit_native.py`,
  `ratchet_native.py` (Phase B+C)
- `capability_native.py`, `crdt_native.py`, `hwkey_native.py` (Phase C-3)
- `routing_native.py`, `prefetch_native.py`, `homology_native.py`
  (Phase D, new in 0.21.0)

PEP 561 type stubs ship from the canonical inline `native/one_link_native/` package.

### Daemon integrations in this development milestone

- `Daemon._observe_prefetch(peer_fp, blob_hex)` hook in `send_file()`
  success path + receiver-side ACK so the prefetch predictor sees
  both ends of every transfer.
- `Daemon.native_diagnostics()` returns prefetch/routing/homology
  availability + native-transfer-v1 advertisement + macaroon-dual-
  issue state for operator inspection.
- `Daemon._pick_best_relay()` sorts relay candidates by τ_c-weighted
  cost (no-op pass-through until per-relay metrics surface lands).

### Testing & verification

- **506 Rust workspace tests** pass / 0 failed
- **107 Python unit tests** pass / 0 failed
- **2,952 Python daemon regression tests** pass / 0 failed
- **Total: 3,565 / 0 failed**
- 9 fuzz targets cover wire formats + state machines + Phase D
  primitives (auto-discovered by nightly CI workflow)
- Property tests via `proptest` across every Phase D crate

### Backward compatibility

- Legacy peers (no `NATIVE_TRANSFER_V1` in caps) transparently stay
  on `FILE_CHUNK` / `FILE_BIN_CHUNK`.
- All daemon migrations are additive — `pq_hybrid.HybridKEM`,
  `caps_grants.encode_grant`, `crdt.merge_manifest_entries`,
  `transfer_brain.AdaptiveTransferBrain` legacy paths all stay
  authoritative or available as fallbacks.

### Rollback flags

- `ONE_LINK_NATIVE_TRANSFER=0` — disable FILE_NATIVE_CHUNK, force
  legacy FILE_CHUNK / FILE_BIN_CHUNK.
- `ONE_LINK_BANDIT_ROUTE_PICKER=0` — disable bandit-driven route
  selection in `AdaptiveTransferBrain.decide()`, fall back to legacy
  multi-route Pareto.

### Batch 2: production-readiness wiring (2026-05-11)

Post-0.21.0-alpha hardening pass landed as commit `5d89838`:

- **Relay metrics surface** — `Daemon.record_relay_observation()` EWMA-
  smooths per-relay `rtt_ms` + `loss_rate` (α=0.2) on every
  `open_relay_outbound` success/failure; `_pick_best_relay()` consumes
  the recorded dict via `_relay_metrics_for()`.
- **ol_codegen enum grammar** — `parse_enum` / `parse_decl` /
  `emit_rust_enum` recognise single-payload + unit variants; u8
  discriminant + variant-payload canonical encoding; 10k-iter byte-
  equivalence property gate.
- **Foldersync native reconciliation** — `FolderEngine.
  _native_reconcile_check()` runs the OR-set add-wins lattice
  decision alongside `merge_manifest_entries` and counts
  disagreements per `receive_remote_manifest` entry; counters surface
  via `native_mirror_stats()` so operators see the diff budget before
  the authoritative-bit flip.
- **Soak test harness** — `tests/test_native_pipeline_soak.py` drives
  2k-iter randomized add/remove/concurrent-edit workload (designed
  for 50k nightly via `ONE_LINK_SOAK_ITERS`); asserts zero native
  mirror divergence + <5% reconcile disagreement budget.
- **ol_fuse scaffold** — `FilesystemBackend` trait + `MemoryBackend`
  reference impl + `mount()` entry point with `MountOptions` /
  `MountError`. Real `fuser::mount2` Linux wiring deferred behind
  `cfg(target_os = "linux")` so Windows / macOS workspace stays clean.

**Hardening pass on batch 2 (this entry's polish)**:
- Native workspace warning sweep: **zero warnings** across the
  `cargo build --release` graph (was 60 pre-sweep; fixed unused
  imports, dead methods, cfg(gil-refs) macro noise via crate-level
  allow, missing-Debug on pyo3 wrapper types).
- Test-build warning sweep: deprecated `rand::Rng::gen` →
  `rand::Rng::random` in `ol_erasure`, `ol_fec`, `ol_bandit` test
  surfaces; dead-code field `identity` in `ol_transfer::engine_e2e`
  renamed `_identity`.
- Criterion benches added for `ol_codegen` (parse + emit on small +
  wide structs + mixed enums) and `ol_fuse` (getattr / read / readdir
  / write on MemoryBackend). Baselines: codegen 213–551 ns parse,
  456 ns emit; FUSE backend 52 ns / 4KiB read, 88 ns getattr-hit,
  53 µs readdir-of-200.
- `out` field annotation fix in `FolderEngine.native_mirror_stats()`
  (mypy clean on the modified surface).
- 8 version-pin regexes + 2 version-floor int-parse tests updated to
  tolerate PEP-440 pre-release suffixes (`0.21.0-alpha`).

**Final test sweep**: 3,069 Python tests passed / 4 skipped /
0 failed (5m32s). Per-crate Rust builds clean across the 21
member crates excluding `one_link_native` + `ol_transfer` (latter
two compile clean when WDAC propagation allows; tests pass at
89 sections / 0 failed.
