"""One Link Rendezvous Server — production aiohttp app.

Runs as a small standalone service that holds, in memory, signed
presence beacons from One Link daemons. Devices on different networks
look each other up here so they can attempt direct connection
(NAT hole-punch in v0.5.1, encrypted relay fallback in v0.5.2).

Deploy as a single Python process behind nginx / Cloudflare / similar
TLS-terminating reverse proxy. The protocol payloads are signed; the
HTTP transport need only be reasonably honest about delivery.

Run with:

    python -m one_link.rendezvous_server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7118

Or via the convenience entrypoint script in `scripts/rendezvous.py`.

Threats this hardens against:

  - **Spoofed registration**: every register/revoke is Ed25519-signed
    by the device's own key. A third party can replay an unmodified
    register, but only inside the 60s replay window, and the registry
    overwrites idempotently.
  - **Resource exhaustion**: per-IP rate limit + per-pubkey rate limit
    + hard cap on total registrations + bounded TTL.
  - **Censoring lookups**: the protocol is symmetric; anyone can run
    their own. There is no authoritative rendezvous.
  - **Plaintext exposure**: this server never receives chat/file plaintext or
    end-to-end keys. It records presence metadata and, when relay is enabled,
    forwards opaque ciphertext while observing its size and timing.

          1. Open WebSocket.
          2. V2 requires a bounded route-set authorization: rotating,
             self-certifying tags signed by their epoch keys. V1 migration
             requires the historical identity-key ListenAuth. Bad auth closes
             with 4001.
          3. V2 atomically installs the opaque route set after ownership and
             capacity checks. V1 takes the identity-keyed slot and may replace
             its prior listener under the replacement limiter.
          4. Server now demuxes incoming connector sessions onto
             this WebSocket.

        Frames received from the listener:
          - binary: `[type][session_id][payload]`. type=DATA → forward
            payload to the connector for that session_id. type=CLOSE →
            terminate the session.
          - text: protocol error after the initial authentication message.

        Frames sent to the listener:
          - binary DATA frames from connectors (server prepends
            session_id so listener can demux).
          - text JSON: `{"t":"incoming","session_id":...}` when a new
            connector arrives.
          - text JSON: `{"t":"session_closed","session_id":...}` when
            a connector disconnects.
