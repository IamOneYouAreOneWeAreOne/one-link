"""Receiver-side file transfer resume across disconnects.

Background. The CDC chunk-store protocol is naturally idempotent:
each FILE_OFFER carries a manifest of (index, hash, size) entries,
and the receiver answers with FILE_WANTS containing only the indices
whose hashes aren't already in the local chunk cache. Chunks live in
the global cache keyed by BLAKE3 hash, so the cache survives a
peer disconnect, a daemon restart, and an OS reboot.

What was missing pre-resume:

  1. The receiver's IncomingFile entry (the in-memory state tying
     a blob_hex to an out_path and a CDC manifest) was lost on
     daemon restart. After a restart the next FILE_OFFER landed
     fresh — same chunks would be re-checked against the cache,
     but the new transfer wrote to a different unique out_path,
     leaving the previous partial output orphaned on disk and
     producing a duplicate filename for the user.

  2. Within a single daemon lifetime, a sender's retry FILE_OFFER
     also overwrote the existing IncomingFile (same blob, but new
     `out_path` from `_unique_inbox_path`). The in-flight handle's
     output file became orphaned; chunks already in the
     ``cdc_parts`` dict were thrown away (the cache still had
     them, so reassembly worked, but the bookkeeping was wasteful).

This module fixes both by persisting a small JSON sidecar per
in-progress CDC offer. The sidecar carries everything needed to
restore the IncomingFile state from disk — the original FILE_OFFER
metadata (peer_fp, blob_hex, name, size, cdc_chunks) plus the
chosen out_path. The actual chunk bytes don't need to live in the
sidecar; they're already in the chunk cache.

Lifecycle:

  * On FILE_OFFER arrival (CDC mode), the receiver writes the
    sidecar before opening the output file handle. Subsequent
    chunk-write events bump ``updated_ms`` but don't rewrite
    the immutable manifest.

  * On clean completion (``_finish_cdc_file`` succeeds) the
    sidecar is deleted.

  * On abort (capability revoke mid-stream, chunk integrity
    failure, peer revoke) the sidecar is deleted along with the
    partial out_path.

  * On daemon startup, the private data directory is scanned for resume
    sidecars. Validated entries are
    registered in an in-memory ``ResumeRegistry`` that the
    FILE_OFFER handler consults before creating fresh state.

Security model.

  * Production sidecar files live outside the remotely writable inbox, under
    the daemon-owned private data directory.  A validated legacy
    ``inbox/.resume`` record may be migrated once, but its acceptance decision
    is reset so inbox content can never manufacture consent.

  * The sidecar's authority is bounded: it can resurrect a
    pending offer's *manifest* and *out_path*, but every chunk
    that lands afterward still goes through the normal
    per-chunk hash check (the existing
    ``cdc_chunk_integrity_failure`` rejection). A poisoned
    sidecar can only redirect the output filename, not inject
    bytes — the actual chunk bytes are content-addressed.

  * On load, ``peer_fp`` from the sidecar must match the peer
    who eventually sends the corresponding FILE_OFFER. A sidecar
    for peer A cannot be activated by a FILE_OFFER from peer B,
    even if the blob_hex matches.

  * ``out_path`` is validated to live under the active inbox root
    on load; a sidecar that points outside is dropped.
