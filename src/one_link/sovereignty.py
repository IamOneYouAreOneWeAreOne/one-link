"""Sovereignty presets — three named tiers + the resolver layer.

May 15 2026.

One Link's promise is "no corps, no calls home, for the people." The
3-tier model below makes LAN/direct operation convenient while keeping
outside routes explicit. Community STUN can discover a public-facing
ICE address; it is not signaling and it cannot relay traffic. A device
on another network therefore still needs a configured signaling or
rendezvous route and, when direct NAT traversal fails, a configured
relay.

Presets:

  - just_works: the default for fresh installs. Update-check ON.
    STUN ON via INDEPENDENT community-run servers (Nextcloud,
    Sipgate, Antisip — never Google/Cloudflare/Twilio). LAN discovery
    ON. No corp accounts, no analytics, no cloud. LAN/direct routes
    work automatically. Cross-network operation requires a configured
    rendezvous/signaling route and, when needed, a configured relay;
    the stock build supplies neither public endpoint.

  - quiet: zero outbound to anything non-LAN. Update-check OFF.
    STUN OFF. LAN discovery ON. For users who pair on their LAN.

  - off_grid: the activist / high-threat profile. Adds: mDNS OFF
    (no broadcast peer discovery), manual pair only via paste-
    connection-string. Pure paranoia mode.

Each preset is defined as a set of feature ceilings that the respective
subsystems read at runtime. Individual settings can tighten the selected
preset — e.g. you can be on just_works but blank out the STUN list. A stale
setting or environment variable cannot loosen Quiet or Off-grid.

Read order:
  1. Preset prohibition — always wins
  2. Explicit setting (state.settings.<key>) — may further disable
  3. Env var override (where one is defined) — may further disable
  4. Preset permit/default — fallback

The audit endpoint surfaces which preset is active + which features
are overridden, so the user always knows what's happening.

# ── Independent community STUN servers ─────────────────────────────

# We deliberately exclude the Big-3 (Google/Cloudflare/Twilio). The
# servers below are operated by community / privacy-focused orgs:
#
#   - Nextcloud  : private-cloud open-source project. Their STUN is
#                  a free community service; no logging policy posted
#                  publicly but the org's stated values align.
#   - Sipgate    : German VoIP telco. GDPR-strict, EU-jurisdiction.
#                  Their STUN is part of their public infrastructure
#                  for SIP clients.
#   - Antisip    : independent SIP operator.
#
# Operators who want to swap these for their own STUN can override
# via env var ONE_LINK_STUN_SERVERS or the ``stun_servers`` setting.
