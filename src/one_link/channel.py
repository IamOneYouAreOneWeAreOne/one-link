"""Encrypted bidirectional channel between two peers.

Handshake (Noise-IK-flavored, simplified):
    1. Initiator -> Responder
       HELLO = init_pub_ed25519 || init_pub_x25519 || nonce_init || sig_init
       sig_init signs: "OL1|HELLO|" + init_pub_ed25519 + init_pub_x25519 + nonce_init
    2. Responder -> Initiator
       REPLY = resp_pub_ed25519 || resp_pub_x25519 || nonce_resp || sig_resp
       sig_resp signs: "OL1|REPLY|" + nonce_init + resp_pub_ed25519 + resp_pub_x25519 + nonce_resp

After both sides verify the other's signature, they:
    shared = X25519(my_x25519_priv, peer_x25519_pub)
    salt   = nonce_init || nonce_resp
    transcript = SHA256(HELLO || REPLY)
    keys   = HKDF(shared, salt, info="OL1/keys|" + transcript, L=64)
    tx_key = keys[0:32]   # initiator -> responder
    rx_key = keys[32:64]  # responder -> initiator

Each side keeps a 64-bit send counter (starts at 0) used as the ChaCha20-Poly1305 nonce
(little-endian, padded to 12 bytes). AAD = "OL1/data|" + transcript.

v0.8.2 Double Ratchet activation
================================

The legacy mode above uses a STATIC tx/rx key pair for the lifetime
of the channel. v0.7.2 shipped an audited Signal-style Double Ratchet
primitive (one_link.double_ratchet); v0.8.2 wires it in.

Activation flow:
  1. Handshake completes as before. Channel stashes the X25519 ephemeral
     PRIVATE key and the peer's X25519 ephemeral PUBLIC key for ratchet
     bootstrap (these were previously discarded after key derivation).
  2. Both sides exchange CAPS frames (legacy-encrypted). Daemon notes
     `note_caps_sent()` after sending CAPS and `note_caps_received(features)`
     when CAPS arrives.
  3. When BOTH flags are set AND both feature lists contain
     DOUBLE_RATCHET_V1, `maybe_activate_ratchet(role)` initialises the
     ratchet state from the handshake bootstrap — and from that point
     forward every send/recv goes through the ratchet, providing forward
     secrecy + post-compromise security.

Cutover: the authenticated, transcript-bound CAPS frame is the final
legacy-AEAD frame in each direction.  Once that exact sequence boundary
is recorded, legacy ciphertext is never accepted again.  Alice can send
ratcheted application data immediately.  Bob's outbound calls queue behind
an event until his first authenticated Alice ratchet frame derives his send
chain; there is no guessed "legacy grace window" and no downgrade fallback.

Wire-format on the ratchet path:
    [length-prefix, unchanged] [42-byte Header.encode()] [ciphertext]

AAD = header.encode() || transcript_hash. Splicing a ratchet frame
across channels fails AEAD (different transcript_hash).

Backward compatibility: peers that don't advertise DOUBLE_RATCHET_V1
stay on legacy. The activation is symmetric — either both speak
ratchet or both stay legacy.
