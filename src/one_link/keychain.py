"""OS keychain integration for One Link's at-rest encryption key.

The state.db SQLCipher passphrase is auto-generated on first run + stored
in the platform-native secure credential store:

    Windows  → Credential Manager (DPAPI-protected blobs)
    macOS    → Keychain Services
    Linux    → Secret Service (libsecret / GNOME Keyring / KWallet)

All three are backed by the `keyring` library, which auto-detects the
right backend per-OS.

Read order for the passphrase, in priority:

  1. `ONE_LINK_PASSPHRASE` env var (explicit override; honored even on
     keychain-capable machines so operators can lock paranoid mode in
     CI / containers without depending on a desktop keychain).
  2. OS keychain entry under the service name `ONE_LINK_KEYCHAIN_SERVICE`,
     account `ONE_LINK_KEYCHAIN_USER`.
  3. Private local ``state.key`` fallback.
  4. None, only after every configured store proves absence.

Auto-mint policy: on first daemon start when (1) and (2) are both empty,
`ensure_passphrase()` generates a fresh 32-byte url-safe-base64
passphrase, writes it to the keychain, and returns it. Subsequent
restarts pick it up via (2) and stay in paranoid mode automatically —
the user never has to remember anything.

Recovery: an inaccessible backend, unreadable/empty local key file, or
ambiguous write outcome is a typed startup failure, never permission to mint
a replacement.  Only proven absence may create.  First publication is
serialized across processes, read back, and either committed to the OS
credential store or atomically linked into a durable private local file.

This module never logs the passphrase, never echoes it to stderr, never
includes it in exception messages, and exposes no method to retrieve it
in a string suitable for display. The bytes only ever leave via direct
return to a caller.

# ── Local key-file fallback ───────────────────────────────────────────
# 2026-06-16 (external-audit remediation): the OS keychain is the
# PREFERRED home for the state.db key, but on headless Linux (no Secret
# Service / D-Bus), locked-down service accounts, or when keyring's
# backend write simply fails, it isn't available. Previously the daemon
# silently fell back to a PLAINTEXT state.db in that case — a direct
# breach of One Link's "your data is yours and protected" promise.
#
# Now, when the OS keychain can't hold the key, we mint one and store it
# in a 0600 key file inside the data dir so at-rest encryption STAYS ON
# by default. Honest about the trade-off: a key file next to the DB is
# weaker than the OS keychain against an attacker who already has read
# access to the data dir — but it is strictly stronger than plaintext
# (opaque DB to backup/cloud-sync scrapes, misconfigured shares,
# forensic free-page recovery, casual inspection) and, combined with
# OS full-disk encryption (FileVault/BitLocker), gives real protection
# on a lost/stolen device. Plaintext now requires an explicit opt-in
# (see state.py ONE_LINK_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT) instead of happening silently.
