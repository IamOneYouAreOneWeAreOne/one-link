"""Build a self-contained PyInstaller onedir application for One Link.

Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.  The launcher is intentionally accompanied
by PyInstaller's ``_internal`` runtime tree; copying or publishing the launcher
alone produces an application that cannot start.
Requires PyInstaller in the active environment:

    pip install pyinstaller

Usage:

    python scripts/build_binary.py
    python scripts/build_binary.py --gui          # windowed (no console)
    python scripts/build_binary.py --include-preview-ml
                                                  # research build only

Output goes to ``dist/one-link/one-link.exe`` on Windows,
``dist/one-link.app`` for the default macOS GUI build, and
``dist/one-link/one-link`` on Linux. Release tooling must archive the complete
onedir/application bundle, never the launcher by itself.

Preview ML bundling:

Stable artifacts deliberately exclude the semantic voice/scene checkpoints,
ONNX Runtime, and preview-only codec modules.  The browser media pipeline does
not yet capture, negotiate, transport, reconstruct, and play these formats end
to end, so shipping their assets by default would add weight without adding a
stable capability.  ``--include-preview-ml`` produces an explicitly labelled
engineering build containing the validated research substrate; it does not
advertise or activate the preview capabilities.

Mandatory native runtime:

Stable standalone builds require an importable ``one_link_native`` package
whose version matches the core package. Its importable submodules are
collected explicitly so the .pyd / .so / .dylib files are bundled without
copying wheel metadata that can contain developer-local paths and
nondeterministic build records. A missing, stale, or wrong-architecture native
wheel fails the build; there is no pure-Python stable-artifact waiver.

Install the matching native wheel before invoking this script, for example:

    pip install one_link_native --find-links \\
      https://github.com/coherence-energy-labs/one-link/releases/latest

The release workflow builds and installs the matching native wheel on each
architecture-specific runner before invoking this script. It also requires a
fresh native CDC sidecar library and executes its ABI known vector before
PyInstaller analysis begins.
