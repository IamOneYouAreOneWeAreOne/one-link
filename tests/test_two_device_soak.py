"""Two-device soak test — regression gate for everything user-visible.

Spawns two real daemons, pairs them via mDNS, then runs a battery of
exercises that touch the surfaces our recent ships affect:

  - Chat: 100 messages back-and-forth (TEXT)
  - Long messages (>600 chars, triggers UI collapse)
  - Unicode + emoji + emoticon-convert candidates
  - File transfer (small + medium)
  - Burst send (10 messages in 100ms)
  - Disconnect / reconnect cycle (kill + restart B)
  - Retry behaviour for offline-then-online sends

Each phase asserts the receiver actually got what the sender sent.
The whole thing runs in ~60-90 seconds; failure surfaces the
"shipped to source, broken in practice" pattern that bit us when
Computer 2 ran an outdated build.

Marked `@pytest.mark.soak` so the slower full suite isn't run on
every `pytest` invocation. Run with:

    pytest -m soak tests/test_two_device_soak.py -v

External audit 2026-05-18 ES-8: this is the soak harness the project
was missing.
