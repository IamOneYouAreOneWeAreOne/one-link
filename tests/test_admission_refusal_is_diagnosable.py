"""A blob-admission refusal must say enough to be solved.

On 2026-08-05 a live-daemon CI run refused a file send with
`admission_blob_in_use_by_another_delivery` and left nothing behind to explain
it: not which delivery held the blob, not how long it had held it, not whether
the holder was still real. It could not be reproduced -- 5/5 passes for that
test alone, 25/25 for the whole file locally, the other three CI matrix legs
green -- so there was no thread to pull.

The guard itself is correct and was deliberately NOT changed. Content already
being delivered under one identity must not be silently adopted by another, and
loosening that on a theory, with no reproduction, is how a real defect gets
introduced while chasing a phantom.

What was missing is evidence. `_incoming_files` entries are released through
the stuck-transfer reaper, which only parks entries whose transfer row appears
in its bounded scan; an entry the reaper never sees would refuse that blob
until the daemon restarts. `held_ms` and `holder_has_transfer_row` exist to
confirm or eliminate exactly that on the next occurrence.

These tests pin the evidence, because a diagnostic nobody verified is a comment
rather than a fix.
