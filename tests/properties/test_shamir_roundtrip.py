"""Properties of the Shamir secret-sharing primitive in
one_link.social_recovery.

Social recovery splits the master seed into N shares such that any
K can reconstruct it. The key invariants are:

  1. ROUND-TRIP: for every (K, N), any K-quorum of the N shares
     reconstructs the original seed exactly.
  2. NO-K-MINUS-1: a quorum of K-1 shares does NOT reconstruct
     the original seed (information-theoretic security property).
  3. ANY-K-SUBSET: ANY K-of-N combination works - not just the
     first K or the last K.

If any of these fail, social recovery is either unusable (legit
quorums can't reconstruct) or broken security (K-1 shares leak
the secret).
