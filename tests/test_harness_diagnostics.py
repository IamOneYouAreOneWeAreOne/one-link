"""The live-daemon harness must explain its own failures.

An intermittent Windows CI failure ("port file did not appear:
...\\control.port") took three tests down in a single run and was
undiagnosable, because the harness reported only the missing filename -- not
whether the daemon was alive, not its exit status, not the log it had already
written. These tests pin the evidence contract so that never recurs.
