"""Integration tests for Wave 2b FILE_OFFER_BATCH.

Crafts a raw FILE_OFFER_BATCH frame containing N small synthetic
offers, sends it via the test-only ``_send_raw_message`` control
hook, and verifies the receiver processes every embedded offer
through the same path a single FILE_OFFER would take.

Skipped if the native crate isn't installed (no daemon pair to
spawn).
