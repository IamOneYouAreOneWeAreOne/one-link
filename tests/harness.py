# ── live-daemon integration gate ───────────────────────────────────
#
# Tests that spawn REAL daemon subprocesses (this harness, plus a few
# files with their own _spawn_daemon helpers) bind ports in the
# well-known range, open many file descriptors, and drive real mDNS.
# Run en masse inside the ~7000-test suite ON A MACHINE ALREADY RUNNING
# LIVE DAEMONS, they starve the host (fd / port / CPU exhaustion) and a
# rotating subset flakes — including hermetic source-inspection tests
# whose inspect.getsource() open() fails when the fd table is full.
#
# So they run in their own quiet lane, gated like the browser-E2E suite:
