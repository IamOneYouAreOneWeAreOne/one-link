"""Two-daemon e2e: accept-first holds an incoming file by default.

Proves the cross-machine behaviour: with the default "always ask"
policy, a standalone FILE_OFFER from peer A is HELD on peer B pending
the user's acceptance (it does NOT auto-download). daemon_pair() gates
itself behind ONE_LINK_RUN_LIVE_INTEGRATION, so this only runs in the
live-integration lane.
