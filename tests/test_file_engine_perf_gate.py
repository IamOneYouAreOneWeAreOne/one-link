"""Perf regression gates for the CDC file engine.

These tests don't measure absolute performance — wall-clock numbers
vary too much across CI runners + developer laptops. They assert
*ranges* that catch regressions of the kind Wave 1d / 1f / 1g / 1i
introduced: a future change that puts the whole file back in heap,
or eats 10× as many wall-clock seconds, will fail one of these.

Each gate has a generous floor so green CI runs aren't flaky. The
goal is "alarm if something obvious broke," not "fail any
slowdown."

Tagged ``@pytest.mark.soak`` so they ride the same opt-in track as
``test_two_device_soak.py`` — pytest -m soak picks them up; a plain
``pytest`` skips them.
