"""Shared fixtures for the browser E2E suite.

The `live_daemon` fixture spawns a real one-link daemon in a temp
ONE_LINK_HOME, waits for it to write `ui.token` + `server.port`,
and yields an object with the base URL + auth token a Playwright
test can navigate to.

The `page` fixture (provided by pytest-playwright) gives each test
its own browser context + page; we add a small wrapper that
auto-navigates to the live daemon with the bearer token in the
query string.

# v0.21.x: gate the browser E2E suite behind an explicit opt-in.
#
# These Playwright (chromium) tests require a real browser + a built
# UI and drive a live daemon. Playwright's sync driver runs its own
# event loop; running it in the SAME pytest process as the ~7000
# unit/integration tests leaves a loop active that pytest-asyncio's
# per-test runner then trips over ("Runner.run() cannot be called
# from a running event loop"), cascading into 500+ spurious setup
# errors on every async test that runs afterward. This is a well-
# known upstream pytest-playwright / pytest-asyncio coexistence
# limitation, not a defect in either our product or these tests.
#
# The correct architecture (used by virtually every project with a
# browser E2E layer) is to run the browser suite in its OWN session:
#
#     ONE_LINK_RUN_BROWSER_E2E=1 pytest tests/e2e/
#
# A bare ``pytest tests/`` (the unit/integration gate) skips them, so
# the unit run stays green AND fully isolated from the Playwright
# loop. The daemon_pair integration tests (tests/test_*_e2e.py) are
# NOT browser tests and continue to run in the normal suite.
