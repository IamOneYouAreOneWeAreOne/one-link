"""v0.10.8 — group sidebar polish.

Three fixes to the group chat surface:
  1. Snap-back bug: refreshPeers' auto-select-the-only-peer branch
     ignored selectedGroup, so a 5-second timer would silently
     restore the previous device chat after the user clicked a
     group. The condition now also checks !state.selectedGroup.
  2. Discoverable settings: every group row in the sidebar now has
     a gear icon, matching the per-device gear convention. The
     conversation header still shows "Group settings" as a
     fallback for keyboard-only users.
  3. Leave group is reachable: the existing modal already had a
     "Leave group" button + handler, but it was unreachable for
     users who didn't know to click into the group first AND
     spot the small text button. The gear unblocks it.
