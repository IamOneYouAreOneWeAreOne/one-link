"""End-to-end test for the Wave 2d/2e daemon-level QUIC pipeline.

Spins up a daemon pair, lets them pair via mDNS, waits for the
ENDPOINT_UPDATE round-trip to publish each side's QUIC port,
then asserts both sides:

  - have a QUIC server endpoint up
  - record the peer's advertised QUIC port
  - can successfully dial that port via the cached-or-open
    helper ``_get_or_dial_quic``
