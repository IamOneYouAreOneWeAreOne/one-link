"""v0.21.x rotation: two-daemon integration test over real wire.

Until now, rotation has only been tested at the unit level: cert
mint/verify round-trips, state cascade with fake peers, handler
stubs with synthetic channels. This test spins up two REAL
daemons, pairs them, rotates A's identity, restarts A in place,
lets A re-handshake B, and asserts B's pinned peer record migrated
to A's NEW fingerprint atomically. The single end-to-end test
catches every wire-protocol bug that unit tests cannot.

Test is slow (~30s on a quiet laptop) because it spans:
  - two daemon boots (~3s each)
  - mDNS convergence (~3s)
  - HTTP pair flow (~1s)
  - rotate + restart cycle (~5s)
  - re-handshake + cert delivery (~10s)
