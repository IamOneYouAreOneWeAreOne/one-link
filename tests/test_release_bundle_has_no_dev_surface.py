"""A release bundle must not carry developer diagnostics.

Audit finding: `one_link/web/dr_test.html` -- a Double Ratchet self-test
harness, served UNGUARDED at `/dr_test` -- was present in the shipped Windows
bundle (verified against the live `auto-latest` artifact). It is loopback-only
and CSP-locked and exposes no secrets, so the severity is low, but it is
surface a user never asked for and cannot benefit from.

The route already has the right behaviour for a bundle without it:

    p = WEB_DIR / "dr_test.html"
    if not p.is_file():
        return web.Response(status=404, text="dr_test.html not bundled")

That branch existed and was unreachable, because the packaging always shipped
the file. Excluding it in the build makes the 404 the real shipped behaviour.

These tests pin both halves -- the exclusion in the build, and the daemon
answering 404 rather than raising when the file is absent -- because either one
alone would let the page come back.
